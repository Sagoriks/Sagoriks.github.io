Experience
======
* TU Munich School Of Life Sciences (via DAAD-WISE'23 Scholarship)
  * This summer I had the oppotunity to intern at Dr. 
    
* Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, England
  * 
    
* University Of Maryland, Baltimore (via BMSIS YSP/VSP)
  * 
 
* Indian Institute Of Technology (BHU) Varanasi
  * Supervisor : Dr. Arun Khattri
      * For the past eight months, I have worked on my master's thesis under Dr. Arun Khattri's supervision, who leads our department's Cancer Genomics group. With a particular interest in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), I have bioinformatically analyzed RNA-seq, Microarray, and WES data for various projects.  The genes and enzymes that interest me the most are SIGLECs and Sialyltransferases, which play key roles in sialylation, a post-translational modification. Cancer cells exploit sialylation for protection and immune evasion. I’ve conducted a literature review on the Sialyltransferases and neuraminidases and their role in the treatment of various cancers as the primary author, which has been published in the Journal Diseases MDPI, titled "Sialyltransferases and Neuraminidases: Potential Targets for Cancer Treatment." I’m also working on a project titled "Integrated gene expression analysis reveals SIGLECs as new targets for Immunotherapy in HNSCC," where we analyze a total of 906 samples from two RNA-seq and two microarray datasets, divide them into subgroups and comparatively study enrichment of various immune cells, gene expression, clinical parameter association, etc. The findings from the study suggest SIGLECs as potential candidates for ICB immunotherapy, and the study of subgroups contributes to personalized treatment of HNSCC patients.
