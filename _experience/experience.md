Experience
======
* TU Munich School Of Life Sciences (via DAAD-WISE'23 Scholarship)
  * This summer I had the oppotunity to intern at TU Munich under the supervision of [Prof. Dmitry Frishman](https://www.mls.ls.tum.de/bioinf/startseite/) and Postdoc [Dr. Barnali Das](https://www.mls.ls.tum.de/bioinf/mitarbeiter/barnali-das/) on the development of a TCR-epitope binding prediction by exploiting AI and pre-trained protein language model embeddings to aid in the development of T-cell immunotherapy approaches. " The model developed had an accuracy of 96% and the manuscript for the same is under preparation. 
    
* Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, England
  * I've worked as a Remote bioinformatics intern for about a year at Rothamsted Research, Harpenden under [Dr. Dan Smith](https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/staff/84v23/dan-smith) and [Dr. Keywan Hassani-Pak](https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/our-people/keywan-hassani-pak) at the Intelligent Data Ecosystems Department to identify genetic factors controlling frost tolerance in wheat using pangenomics. We worked on a QTL located at the 5A chromosome of wheat and identified a large amount of structural variation amongst cultivars. Potential frost resistance controlling genes and Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were identified and a pipeline to identify structural variation in a pangenome was developed.
    
* University Of Maryland, Baltimore (via BMSIS YSP/VSP)
  * As a visiting scholar at [DasSarma Lab](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/dassarma_lab/), University of Maryland, Baltimore, I've worked on examining the UV-resistant properties of Haloachaea via the analysis of their DNA repair systems, especially photorepair. I've performed phylogenetic analysis, synteny analysis, and structural protein studies correlating the mutations in the protein photolyase with the survival of Halophiles under varying UV strengths. The results from the same have been published in the Journal Microorganisms MDPI, titled "[Genomic Analysis of Haloarchaea from Diverse Environments, including Permian Halite, Reveals Diversity of Ultraviolet Radiation Survival and DNA Photolyase Gene Variants](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/11/3/607)", where I served as the primary author. 
 
* Indian Institute Of Technology (BHU) Varanasi
  * Supervisor : [Dr. Arun Khattri](https://khattri-lab.github.io/)
      * For the past eight months, I have worked on my master's thesis under Dr. Arun Khattri's supervision, who leads our department's Cancer Genomics group. With a particular interest in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), I have bioinformatically analyzed RNA-seq, Microarray, and WES data for various projects.  The genes and enzymes that interest me the most are SIGLECs and Sialyltransferases, which play key roles in sialylation, a post-translational modification. Cancer cells exploit sialylation for protection and immune evasion. I’ve conducted a literature review on the Sialyltransferases and neuraminidases and their role in the treatment of various cancers as the primary author, which has been published in the Journal Diseases MDPI, titled "[Sialyltransferases and Neuraminidases: Potential Targets for Cancer Treatment](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9721/10/4/114)." I’m also working on a project titled "Integrated gene expression analysis reveals SIGLECs as new targets for Immunotherapy in HNSCC," where we analyze a total of 906 samples from two RNA-seq and two microarray datasets, divide them into subgroups and comparatively study enrichment of various immune cells, gene expression, clinical parameter association, etc. The findings from the study suggest SIGLECs as potential candidates for ICB immunotherapy, and the study of subgroups contributes to personalized treatment of HNSCC patients. 
  * Supervisor : [Dr. Rajnish Kumar](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/phe/people/rajnishphe)
       * I've  worked on literature projects with Dr. Rajnish Kumar at my home university and published a literature review 3 Biotech titled "[Deep learning tools for advancing drug discovery and development](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13205-022-03165-8)" as the primary author and co-authored a chapter on "[Big data in Drug discovery](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-16-5993-5)," which has been published in the book Machine Learning and Systems Biology in Genomics and Health, Springer Singapore 2022.
