Hi there, I am Sagorika Nag, a 5th-year Integrated dual degree (IDD) student pursuing pharmaceutical engineering and technology at the Indian Institute Of Technology (BHU) Varanasi. I love solving biological problems using computational approaches, especially in the areas of cancer genomics and immunology!
