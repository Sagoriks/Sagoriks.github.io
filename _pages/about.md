Hi there, I am Sagorika Nag, a 5th-year Integrated dual degree (IDD) student pursuing pharmaceutical engineering and technology at the [Indian Institute Of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://iitbhu.ac.in/). I conduct computational biology research, especially in the areas of cancer genomics and immunology!

As a part of my master's thesis, I am working on the identification of molecular targets for the treatment of Head and Nech Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) with a particular interest in genes involved in sialylation that promote immune evasion. I'm also working on TCR-epitope binding prediction using AI and pre-trained protein language model embeddings as an intern at [Prof. Frischmann's lab](https://www.mls.ls.tum.de/bioinf/startseite/), Technical University of Munich, School of Life Sciences.
