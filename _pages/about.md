Hi there, I am Sagorika Nag, a 5th-year Integrated dual degree (IDD) student pursuing pharmaceutical engineering and technology at the [Indian Institute Of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://iitbhu.ac.in/). I conduct computational biology research, especially in the areas of cancer genomics and immunology!

As a part of my master's thesis, I am working on the identification of molecular targets for the treatment of Head and Nech Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) with a particular interest in genes involved in sialylation that promote immune evasion. I'm also working on TCR-epitope binding prediction using AI and pre-trained protein language model embeddings as a DAAD-WISE'23 intern at [Technical University of Munich, School of Life Sciences](https://www.ls.tum.de/en/ls/home/). 

I have previously worked at [Rothamsted Research](https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/), Harpenden, England remotely as a bioinformatics intern in the intelligent data ecosystems department. I have also served as a research scholar at the [DasSarma Lab](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/dassarma_lab/) via the [BMSIS Young Scientist Program (YSP)](https://bmsis.org/ysp/).
